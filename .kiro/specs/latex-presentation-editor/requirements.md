# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a comprehensive presentation editor that combines the visual editing capabilities of PowerPoint with the typesetting power of LaTeX. The application will provide a graphical user interface for creating presentations with drag-and-drop functionality, real-time preview, and instant generation of high-quality PDF presentations using LaTeX as the rendering backend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Presentation Creation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create new presentations with slides, so that I can build structured content for my presentations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a new presentation with one blank slide
2. WHEN the user clicks "New Slide" THEN the system SHALL add a new slide to the presentation
3. WHEN the user selects a slide THEN the system SHALL display that slide in the main editing area
4. WHEN the user deletes a slide THEN the system SHALL remove it from the presentation and update the slide navigation

### Requirement 2: Drag-and-Drop Content Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to drag and drop text boxes, images, and shapes onto slides, so that I can quickly arrange content without complex menus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user drags a text element from the toolbar THEN the system SHALL create a new text box on the slide at the drop location
2. WHEN the user drags an image file onto a slide THEN the system SHALL insert the image at the drop location
3. WHEN the user drags an existing element on a slide THEN the system SHALL move that element to the new position
4. WHEN the user drags to resize an element THEN the system SHALL update the element dimensions in real-time
5. WHEN the user drops an element outside the slide boundaries THEN the system SHALL constrain the element to the slide area

### Requirement 3: Real-time LaTeX Rendering

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my presentation rendered instantly as I make changes, so that I can preview the final output without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user makes any change to slide content THEN the system SHALL regenerate the LaTeX code within 500ms
2. WHEN LaTeX code is generated THEN the system SHALL compile it to PDF and display the result
3. WHEN compilation fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages and maintain the previous valid preview
4. WHEN the user switches slides THEN the system SHALL display the rendered version of the selected slide

### Requirement 4: Text Editing and Formatting

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit text with rich formatting options, so that I can create professional-looking presentations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user double-clicks a text box THEN the system SHALL enter text editing mode
2. WHEN the user selects text THEN the system SHALL display formatting options (bold, italic, font size, color)
3. WHEN the user applies formatting THEN the system SHALL update both the visual display and underlying LaTeX code
4. WHEN the user adds mathematical expressions THEN the system SHALL render them using LaTeX math mode
5. WHEN the user creates bullet points THEN the system SHALL format them as LaTeX lists

### Requirement 5: Shape and Drawing Tools

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add shapes, lines, and drawings to my slides, so that I can create diagrams and visual elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a shape tool THEN the system SHALL allow drawing that shape on the slide
2. WHEN the user draws a shape THEN the system SHALL convert it to appropriate LaTeX/TikZ code
3. WHEN the user modifies shape properties THEN the system SHALL update the LaTeX representation
4. WHEN the user connects shapes with lines THEN the system SHALL maintain those connections during moves

### Requirement 6: Image and Media Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to insert and manipulate images in my presentations, so that I can include visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user imports an image THEN the system SHALL embed it in the LaTeX document
2. WHEN the user resizes an image THEN the system SHALL maintain aspect ratio by default
3. WHEN the user crops an image THEN the system SHALL update the LaTeX image parameters
4. IF the image format is not LaTeX-compatible THEN the system SHALL convert it to a supported format

### Requirement 7: Slide Templates and Themes

**User Story:** As a user, I want to apply professional templates and themes to my presentations, so that I can create consistent, attractive slides.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a template THEN the system SHALL apply it to all slides in the presentation
2. WHEN the user changes theme colors THEN the system SHALL update the LaTeX color definitions
3. WHEN the user modifies slide layouts THEN the system SHALL preserve content while updating positioning
4. WHEN the user creates custom templates THEN the system SHALL save them for future use

### Requirement 8: Export and Sharing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my presentations in multiple formats, so that I can share them with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks export THEN the system SHALL generate a high-quality PDF using LaTeX
2. WHEN the user requests LaTeX source THEN the system SHALL provide the complete LaTeX document
3. WHEN the user exports to PowerPoint format THEN the system SHALL convert layouts to PPTX structure
4. WHEN export fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggestions

### Requirement 9: Collaboration Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and load presentations, so that I can work on them over time and share with collaborators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user saves a presentation THEN the system SHALL store both the visual layout and LaTeX source
2. WHEN the user opens a saved presentation THEN the system SHALL restore all elements and formatting
3. WHEN the user imports a PowerPoint file THEN the system SHALL convert it to the internal format
4. WHEN the user auto-saves THEN the system SHALL preserve work without user intervention

### Requirement 10: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to respond quickly to my actions, so that my workflow isn't interrupted by delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user performs any UI action THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms
2. WHEN LaTeX compilation occurs THEN the system SHALL not block the user interface
3. WHEN working with large presentations THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance
4. WHEN rendering complex slides THEN the system SHALL use progressive loading techniques
